# pokeminer

Pokemon Go scraper capable of scanning large area for Pokemon spawns over long period of time. Suitable for gathering data for further analysis.

Based on an early version of [AHAAAAAAA/PokemonGo-Map](https://github.com/AHAAAAAAA/PokemonGo-Map), currently it uses [tejado/pgoapi](https://github.com/tejado/pgoapi).

## Oh great, another map?

This is not *a map*. Yeah, map is included, but main goal of this app is to *gather data* and put it in the database for further analysis. There are several other projects (including aforementioned PokemonGo-Map) that do better job at being just a map.

## How does it work?

`worker.py` gets rectangle as a start..end coordinates (configured in `config.py`) and spawns *n* workers. Each of the worker uses different Google/PTC account to scan its surrounding area for Pokemon. To put it simply: **you can scan entire city for Pokemon**. All gathered information is put into a database for further processing (since servers are unstable, accounts may get banned, Pokemon disappear etc.). `worker.py` is fully threaded, waits a bit before rescanning, and logins again after X scans just to make sure connection with server is in good state. It's also capable of restarting workers that are misbehaving, so that data-gathering process is uninterrupted.

There's also  a simple interface for gathered data that displays active Pokemon on a map. It can generate nicely-looking reports, too.

Here it is in action:

And here are workers together with their area of scan:

## Bulletpoint list of features

- multithreaded, multiple accounts at the same time
- aims at being very stable for long-term runs
- able to map entire city (or larger area) in real time
- data gathering for further analysis
- visualization
- reports for gathered data

## Setting up

[/u/gprez](https://www.reddit.com/u/gprez) made [a great tutorial on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongodev/comments/4tz66s/pokeminer_your_individual_pokemon_locations/d5lovb6). Check it out if you're not accustomed with Python applications.

Create the database by running Python interpreter. Note that if you want more than 10 workers simultaneously running, SQLite is probably not the best choice.

```py
$> python
Python 2.7.10 (default, Jan 13 2016, 14:23:43)
[GCC 4.8.4] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import db
>>> db.Base.metadata.create_all(db.get_engine())
```

Copy `config.py.example` to `config.py` and modify as you wish. See [wiki page](https://github.com/modrzew/pokeminer/wiki/Config) for explanation on properties.

Run the worker:

```
python worker.py
```

Optionally run the live map interface and reporting system:

```
python web.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

## Reports

There are two reports:

1. Overall report, available at `/report`
2. Single species report, available at `/report/<pokemon_id>`

Here's how the overall report looks like:

## Using PokeSpawn with PokeMiner

We need to install some libraries

```
pip install tweepy --upgrade
pip install python-telegram-bot --upgrade
```

Then, we can open the file pokespawn_release.py and fill some data.

1. Line 32: we have to enter our Google Maps API key.
2. If we want to use a Twitter account to post the location, we need to uncomment the block in line 35 and fill the data with our Twitter Apps credentials.
3. Line 55: insert your Telegram bot secret key.
4. Line 267 and 268: edit the @channel/group with your @channel name. The bot MUST be added as administrator.

To change the Pokemon that must be alerted, edit the line 241. To split your location from your ZIP code given by Google, edit the line 262 with the first digits.

*The code is messy and dirty*

To execute, just use. The worker should be running because otherwhise, there won't be any active Pokemons.
```
python pokespawn_release.py
```
